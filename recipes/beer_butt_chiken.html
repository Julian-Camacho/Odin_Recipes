    <p>A whole chicken is seasoned and slowly cooked on the grill. This is a bit unorthodox, but the end result is moist, flavorful, and amazing. All you'll need is some chicken, butter, beer, and seasonings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer</li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat.</li>
        <li>In a small skillet, melt 1/2 cup butter. Mix in 1 tablespoon garlic salt, 1 tablespoon paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Discard 1/2 the beer, leaving the remainder in the can. Add remaining butter, garlic salt, paprika, and desired amount of salt and pepper to beer can. Place can on a disposable baking sheet. Set chicken on can, inserting can into the cavity of the chicken. Baste chicken with the melted, seasoned butter.</li>
        <li>Place baking sheet with beer and chicken on the prepared grill. Cook over low heat for about 3 hours, or until internal temperature of chicken reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
